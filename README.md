  # The Social Network API

  ## Description 
  We are tasked with creating the Social Network API from scratch using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js. 

  The user will be able to use this API for the Social Network to create new users with a valid username and email, add other users as friends, and post "Thoughts" and "Reactions". The user can also update and delete "Thoughts" and "Reactions" as well as remove "Friends". You are one step closer to accessing the Social Network!
